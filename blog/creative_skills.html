                    <p>Now we'll do a lot of animation while doing Video Editing, but for some of us who have a bit of a cartoony side this is the thing you're looking for, All cartoons (except the 3D ones) you see are made using Flash.</p>
                    <p>We'll also be adding to this - Console Game Programming, if you have played online games on the internet - like on <a href="http://www.cartoonnetworkindia.com/games">Cartoon Network's website</a> or Farmville on Facebook, those are made using Flash Professional and a bit (actually a lot) of Javascript.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">From stunning visual effects to your favourite animation movies its all 3D.</span>
                    <p>It is cool to use 2D for making cartoons etc. but the modern world demands something more realistic - 3D. From Ironman's suit to Hulk it's all 3D. In fact all movies with Visual Effects use 3D, also animation movies like Toy Story, Kung Fu Panda etc. are made using these 3D software, Object Visualization like architecture, cars and gadgets etc. are also be made in these software.</p>
                    <p>We'll teach you how to model (create) and animate all sorts of 3D Geometry/Models, you can even create your own 3D game after this with a bit of other stuff. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Which one to choose?</h2>

                    <p>When you have a variety of things to do it becomes difficult to choose which one to do.</p>
                    
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/creative_skills/many_choices.jpg" alt="Loading...">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">When you have a variety of things to do it becomes difficult to choose which one to do.</span>
                    
                    <p>Fortunately all these fields are related to each other, you need an audio for a video and 3D Animations or Models most of the times end up in a video or it ends up as an image which you can further edit, design is also used in other fields like making a flash animation etc. But am I not confusing you more?</p>
                    <strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Video Editing // Movie Making</li>
                        <li>Audio Editing</li>

                        <li>Designing (logos, illustrations etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                     </strong>
                    <p>I advise you start with something you admire the most, is it 3D or audio or anything in the list above; YOU DECIDE.</p>
